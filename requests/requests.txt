MAY 27:
-------------------------------
Hi Alex

I got a reaction from Roger Treece. He likes the Randomizer and wants to use it, and sends you best regards and thanks.

He asked for a little change:
- coordinate the Anchor options to the Mode options, 
- so that the three “minor” modes (dorian, phrygian and aeolian) would only bring up mi3 or p5 as options in the Anchor window 
- and the three “major” modes (ionian, lydian and mixolydian) would bring up only the ma3 and p5 as options in the Anchor window.

In other words:
- if the mode is dorian, phrygian and aeolian instead of mi3/ma3 should only appear mi3 in the anchor window
- if the mode is ionian, lydian and mixolydian instead of mi3/ma2 should nly appear ma3 in the anchor window
- the anchor option p5 is ok.

Could you do that? (if it is not to much work...)
That would be great.

Hugs
Mattias
